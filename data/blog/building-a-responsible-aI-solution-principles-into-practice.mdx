## Introduction

This is part 2 of my series of posts on fairness in AI, reflections from a participant in the Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) Global Veritas Challenge. In my first post, I discussed the need to adopt a human-centric approach when dealing with issues of fairness in AI systems. After hours of brainstorming, user interviews and smashing bits of code together, we created VerifyML, an open-source framework to help organisations build fair and responsible models. The solution was one of the three winning submissions of the Veritas challenge! `shadows`

```ts:./index.js {1,3}
const obj1 = { a: 1, b: 2 }

const obj2 = { c: 3 }

const obj3 = { d: 4 }
```

My teammates have written about VerifyML in detail, so if you are interested in giving it a spin, check out the following introductory posts:

```tsx:pages/blog/index.tsx {6, 10-14}
import { defineDocumentType, makeSource } from 'contentlayer/source-files'

export async function getStaticPaths(): Promise<GetStaticPathsResult> {
  console.log(123, allBlogs)

  const paths = allBlogs.map(article => {
    return {
      params: [ slug: article.slug ],
    }
  })

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  }
}

type ParamsProps = {
  slug: string
}

<DateFormatArticle dateArticle={date} />
<span className="mr-1">|</span>
<ShareArticle articleLink={articleSlug} articleTitle={shareTitle} />
<span className="mx-1">|</span>
<EditArticle slug={articleSlug} />
```

```yml
{
  type: 'element',
  tagName: 'pre',
  properties: {},
  children: [
    {
      type: 'element',
      tagName: 'code',
      properties: { className: [ 'language-py' ] },
      children: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          value: 'def factorial(x):\n' +
            '    """This is a recursive function\n' +
            '    to find the factorial of an integer"""\n' +
            '\n' +
            '    if x == 1:\n' +
            '        return 1\n' +
            '    else:\n' +
            '        return (x * factorial(x-1))\n'
        }
      ],
      position: {
        start: { line: 11, column: 1, offset: 242 },
        end: { line: 20, column: 4, offset: 452 }
      },
      data: { meta: '{5-6, 8} showLineNumbers' }
    }
  ],
  position: {
    start: { line: 11, column: 1, offset: 242 },
    end: { line: 20, column: 4, offset: 452 }
  }
}
```

In this post, I take a step back and share some of the things I have learned while developing this solution. I start from the user interviews and feedback that we have gathered, before discussing existing tools in the model governance space, and concluding with how we designed a solution that addresses the problem.
